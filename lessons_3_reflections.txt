When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you are collaborating with others on a single project 
-If you are working on something in multiple locations and on differnt PC.
-If you wanted your work to be view or reviewed by public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To gurantee that you have the latest up to date information.
