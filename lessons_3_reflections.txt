When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you are collaborating with others on a single project 
-If you are working on something in multiple locations and on differnt PC.
-If you wanted your work to be view or reviewed by public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To gurantee that you have the latest up to date information.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - used to create a copy of someone elses repository for you to update. 
Clones - used to create a copy of the repository in a different location (locally or from github)
Branches - used to create a different steam that changes don't affect other brahnches.
