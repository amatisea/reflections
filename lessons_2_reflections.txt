What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialise a repository it creates turns a normal folder into a git repository that changes can be tracked in. This is needed because otherwise the folder would no be under version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is different from the working directory is all files in the working directory aren't nescessary in the staging area.
Staging area is different from the repository as files in the staging area are not avaliable in version control as such yet but are ready to be commited to a repository.
What value this adds means you can pick and choose what you want to commit.
